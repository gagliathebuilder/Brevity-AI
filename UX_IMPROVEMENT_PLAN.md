### 2. Improved User Feedback

- **Success Animations**: Add subtle animations for completed actions

### 3. Analysis Result Display
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organize analysis results into tabs (Thematic Analysis, Email Draft, Social Share)
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of analysis or sections
- **Export Options**: Allow downloading results as PDF, markdown, or plain text
