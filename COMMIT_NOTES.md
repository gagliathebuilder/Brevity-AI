# Thematic Analysis Implementation with Enhanced Error Handling

## Overview
This commit adds a structured thematic analysis feature to the content summarization system, reorganizing AI responses into clear themes with key points. It also adds robust error handling throughout the application and fixes critical issues with URL content extraction for web pages, YouTube videos, and podcasts.

## Key Changes

### Thematic Analysis Structure
- Implemented a structured theme-based analysis format with 3-5 main themes and bullet points
- Added automatic generation of email drafts and social media shares from the analysis
- Enhanced content parsing and formatting for better readability

### Content Extraction Improvements
- Fixed web content fetching with proper User-Agent headers, timeout limits, and content validation
- Improved YouTube transcript retrieval with fallback mechanisms for videos without captions
- Enhanced podcast transcript extraction with multiple data sources
- Implemented content truncation to avoid exceeding token limits

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error types and status codes
- Implemented better error messages for debugging and user feedback
- Improved robustness against malformed inputs and network issues
- Fixed frontend-backend integration issues with response format compatibility

### Testing
- Created dedicated test scripts for YouTube and web content analysis
- Added a test suite for handling problematic URLs
- Implemented better debugging and logging

## Technical Implementation

### Content Analysis Enhancements
- Simplified and improved the OpenAI prompt for generating more consistent analyses
- Added content type detection for specialized processing
- Implemented fallback mechanism for generating email drafts and social shares
- Improved content cleaning and formatting

### Web Content Extraction
- Added multiple extraction methods to maximize chances of getting meaningful content
- Improved HTML cleaning and text processing
- Added content validation to ensure quality before analysis

### Error Handling
